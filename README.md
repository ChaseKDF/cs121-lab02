## Activity 1 - Lincoln (pp2.1)
### Problem Description
Create a revised version of the Lincoln application from the Chapter 1 code examples such that quotes appear around the quotation.
### Implementation Guide
1. Open the Chapter 1 code examples and copy Lincoln.java into the A1-Lincoln folder
2. Update the program as described in the Problem Description
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 1 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Activity 2 - AverageOfThree (pp2.2)
### Problem Description
Write an application that reads three integers and prints their average.
### Implementation Guide
1. Expanded the folder named A2-AverageOfThree and create a new file named AverageOfThree.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in AverageOfThree.java
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 2 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Activity 3 - HMSConverter (pp2.6)
### Problem Description
Write an application that reads values representing a time duration in hours, minutes, and seconds, and then prints the equivalent total number of seconds.  (For example, 1 hours, 28 minutes, 42 seconds is equivalent to 5322 seconds.)

### Impementation Guide
1. Expanded the folder named A3-HMSConverter and create a new file named HMSConverter.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in HMSConverter.java
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 3 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Activity 4 - SecondsConverter (pp2.7)
### Problem Description
Create a version of the previous project that reversed the computation.  That is, read a value representing a number of seconds, and then print the equivalent amount of time as a combination of hourse, minutes, and seconds. (For example, 9999 seconds is equivalent to 2 hours, 46 minutes, and 39 seconds.)

### Impementation Guide
1. Expanded the folder named A4-SecondsConverter and create a new file named SecondsConverter.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in SecondsConverter.java
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 4 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Activity 5 - FractionConverter (pp2.11)
### Problem Description
Write an application that prompts for and reads the numerator and denominator of a fraction as integers and then prints the decimal equivalent of the fraction.

### Impementation Guide
1. Expanded the folder named A5-FractionConverter and create a new file named FractionConverter.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in FractionConverter.java
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 5 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.
